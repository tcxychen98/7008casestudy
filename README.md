# Project Overview

This repository presents a comprehensive case study focusing on E-commerce customer behavior analysis. The primary objectives of this project are to gain insights into customer churn behavior, identify key factors influencing customer interactions, and develop data-driven strategies to prevent churn while promoting customer growth.

## Tools Used

- **SAS e-Miner:**
  - SAS e-Miner plays a crucial role in this project by providing robust tools for modeling and analysis. It facilitates the creation of predictive models, including decision trees, gradient boosting, and ensemble methods, to uncover patterns in customer behavior and predict potential churn.

- **Talend Data Integration:**
  - Talend Data Integration is utilized for efficient and seamless combination of diverse datasets. It streamlines the process of integrating data from various sources, ensuring a unified and comprehensive dataset for analysis in SAS e-Miner.

- **Talend Data Prep:**
  - Talend Data Prep contributes to the project by addressing data quality concerns. It enables the removal of errors and rectification of inconsistencies within the dataset, ensuring that the input to SAS e-Miner is accurate and reliable.

The documentation for all these tools are explained more in depth in the case study report located in the Report folder.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Integration with Talend:**
   - Combining both customer data and data from marketing campaign to generate a unified dataset

2. **Data Cleaning with Talend Data Prep:**
   - To identify and rectify errors within the dataset. This step is crucial for ensuring the quality and reliability of input data for analysis later on.

3. **Modeling and Analysis with SAS e-Miner:**
   - SAS e-Miner is utilized for modeling and analysis, employing decision trees, gradient boosting, and ensemble methods to gain insights into customer behavior, particularly focusing on churn prediction.

4. **Insightful Conclusions and Strategies:**
   - The analysis results are translated into actionable insights, leading to the formulation of business strategies aimed at preventing churn and promoting customer growth.

## Reflection & Learning Outcome

This case study taught me a lot about analyzing data in e-commerce. I used tools like SAS e-Miner, Talend Data Integration, and Talend Data Prep to understand customer behavior. I learned to make decision trees and predict if customers might stop using the service. Fixing mistakes in the data was important, and combining different datasets helped see the whole picture. Figuring out what the data tells us was not always easy, but it showed me the value of good data for making smart business decisions. Overall, it was a useful experience, and I now feel more confident in using these tools for future projects.
